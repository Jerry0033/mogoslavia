institution_events.2.d:0 "Since the 14th century, the wealthy and powerful in the coastal Mediterranean states have been patronizing artists and scholars willing to explore the old Punic, Latin and Greek societies of their forefathers. As a cultural movement, the Renaissance already encompasses most of the region and has had a profound impact on literature, art, philosophy and music. Humanist scholars are also analyzing the society in which they live, comparing it to the ideals of the classical philosophers. At the turn of $YEAR$ Renaissance humanism has grown into a more mature movement, ready to permeate all aspects of society. A new ideal for rulers as well as those who are ruled is spreading as quickly as the early printers can distribute copies of these new ideas. A true Renaissance humanist is an expert on everything from politics and philosophy to art, textual analysis, music and architecture. The Renaissance is now ready to reshape the world to better fit the classical ideals."

 institution_events.4.d:1 "The ability to mass-produce the written word would revolutionize the spread of information, and in many ways early modern society as a whole. Pioneered by many Renaissance men, the new art helped fuel the Renaissance by making the translated classics more widely available. Later the Reformation benefitted greatly from the ability to spread critical publications and translations of the Archonic diktats.\n\nNow that Printing has matured as a technique and spread throughout [institution_origin.GetContinentName], hundreds of thousands of copies of everything from religious and political pamphlets to scientific treatises and instructions on how to behave are circulating the continent. With print shops growing evermore commonplace, rulers have found it hard to contain the new technique, as the comparatively easy means of production makes it easy for censorship to be sidestepped by moving business across a border or even just changing the name on a title page."

  institution_events.5.d:0 "Goods have been moved across continents since antiquity. But where this was previously limited to a set number of routes and goods such as the manufactured goods of India and China finding their way across the Indian Ocean and along the Silk Road, all trade is now increasingly becoming part of a greater world network. With the discovery of the Americas, sea routes around Africa and the crossing of the Pacific Ocean, local trade networks are being connected into one world-spanning interconnected web.\n\nSilver mined in the Andes is now being boxed and taken via Europe all the way to China and India. Iron mined and wrought in Scandinavia is being sold in West Africa by Celtic merchants, and others are making a fortune just distributing cloth and spices within the South East Asian trade sphere. Local Indian merchants are investing in future European trade ventures. It may still be early to speak of a truly Global Economy but surely the first seeds have been sown."

 elective_monarchy.1.d: "The Confederation stood united today in their support for $HEIR$ $HEIR_DYNASTY$, who despite $HEIR_ADJ$ foreign roots is viewed as a worthy successor to the throne of $COUNTRY$. This will strengthen his chance to assume power, should our current $MONARCHTITLE$ pass away."
 elective_monarchy.2.t: "The Confederation Opposes $HEIR$ $HEIR_DYNASTY$"
 elective_monarchy.2.d: "A powerful faction within the Confederation has made clear their displeasure and dislike for $HEIR$ $HEIR_DYNASTY$, whom they view as a foreigner that has no understanding of the country $HEIR_S_PRONOUN$ wishes to rule. Their campaign has weakened $HEIR_ADJ$ chance to assume power, should our current $MONARCHTITLE$ pass away."
 elective_monarchy.3.t: "Bribing the Confederation"
 elective_monarchy.4.d: "A certain faction within the Confederation have made no secret of their dislike for $HEIR$ $HEIR_DYNASTY$, and now your spymaster has uncovered that they are plotting the assassination of $HEIR_ADJ$. If they are allowed to make the attempt, there is a considerable risk that we will be blamed, but arresting them would upset their friends in the Confederation. How should we proceed?"
 elective_monarchy.10.t: "The Confederation Forces Abdication"
 elective_monarchy.10.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] knows that [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] time may soon come. Wishing to secure the title for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] dynasty, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has begun to seek support for selecting one of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] progeny as next in line, questioning the choice of the Confederation. The nobles have not taken kindly to this and are considering forcing the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to abdicate in favor of the heir they have already chosen for the throne."
 elective_monarchy.13.d: "Being of [Root.Culture.GetName] birth, [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] often visits [Root.GetName]. Not only does the province serve as a reminder to the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] of [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] past, but the people there who normally feel somewhat estranged from their [Root.Owner.GetAdjective] rulers are glad to see that the Confederation approved a monarch who speaks their language. A recent visit has considerably improved the locals' impression of the administration."
 elective_monarchy.14.d: "Electing monarchs from different nations allows us, to some extent, to avoid a dynasty taking control over [Root.GetName] entirely, but also causes foreign nobles to sometimes doubt our loyalty. The [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] family to which our current [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] belongs has noticed that the increased support in the Confederation for [Root.Heir.GetName] of the [Root.Heir.Dynasty.GetName] dynasty. Although they hopefully understand that they can't rule our nation forever, they are beginning to ask questions about how this will affect future cooperation between us."
 elective_monarchy.14.a: "Assure them that the Confederation stays loyal to the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] line."
 elective_monarchy.14.c: "Stay neutral. The Confederation owes allegiance only to [Root.GetName]."
 elective_monarchy.15.t: "[From.GetAdjective] Confederation Shifts Allegiance"
 elective_monarchy.15.d: "After a noble of the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] family ascended to the [From.GetAdjective] throne, we were hoping to see a long-time rule there by our dynasty. However, the Confederation's support of another foreign heir has strained the relationship between our nations. When pressured, [From.GetName] has made it clear that the times are changing, and that they are trying to avoid another monarch from [Root.GetName]."
 elective_monarchy.16.t: "[From.GetAdjective] Confederation Turns to Us"
 elective_monarchy.16.d: "[From.GetName] has been under pressure from the [From.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] to maintain the bloodline's hold of their throne, but the Confederation has spoken against them, in our favor. [From.Heir.GetName], already having popular support in the Confederation, is now considered their primary candidate for escaping the dynasty's grip and avoiding an absolutist monarch."
 elective_monarchy.17.d: "Ruling in [Root.GetName] is not like ruling in other nations. Dictating the nation's goals is difficult without approval from nobles, sometimes impossible. To a foreign monarch, this may seem disappointing and frustrating, but this cornerstone of [Root.GetAdjective] politics is highly valued in its homeland and is, in fact, what [Root.Monarch.GetName] has to thank for coming into power in the first place. Embracing these ideas might make the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] seem weak internationally, but would aid in integrating better and gaining supporters in the Confederation."

string_start_federation_generic: "In the aftermath of §YCarthage§!'s victory in the §YThird Punic War§!, Italia and and its people were thrown into turmoil. It took centuries of civil war and bickering for peace to finally reign in the region, beginning with the signing of the §YLeague of Roma§! in 978, which created the §YItalian Federation§!. The independent rulers of Italia agreed to assist each other in times of need, and pool their resources towards creating a brighter future for all their peoples.\n\nOver the centuries, trade with the African coast led to §YPunic§! cultural and religious practices seeping into the peninsula, where they now form the majority in most parts except the northern plains, a stronghold of the defiant §YRomana§! faith. Initially, there was peace between the faiths of the Federation, but with the turn of the 14th century, tensions began to rise. Interest in the heritage of the §YRoman Republic§! was growing, and both the Punic and Romana princes wished to stake their claim to that venerable bloodline.\n\nThe powerful kingdom of §YItalia§! has consolidated control over much of the north, and is now the strongest Romana member of the Federation, but even it is constantly threatened by the whim of the §YGrand Adirim§!. In 1443, an alliance of §YRoma§!, §YNaples§!, §YFlorence§!, and §YSerenza§! invaded Italia and handily defeated them and their allies in §YFerrara§!, deposing the old king and instituting a new government under the oversight of the §YScarlet Delegation§!. Despite the success of this campaign, the situation seems to still be precarious, and any Adirim or prince will have to be careful to manage the religious tensions within the Federation, lest they boil over and plunge the whole alliance into a bloody war.\n\nThe princes of the south of Italia are divided and fiercely independent. Home to a number of free cities and prosperous towns, the region claims to have its own unique identity separate from the other Romqart peoples, and dream of one day uniting this '§YMeridia§!' under one banner. On Sicily, the invasion of the zealot §YConan Astarte§! earlier in the year has thrown the island into chaos, leaving the future of the Trinacrian people hanging in the balance.\n\nThe maritime republics of §YPunicum§! and §YSerenza§! are the economic powerhouses of the Federation, each flanking the seas beside the Italian peninsula. Their influence is extensive and their wealth is vast, but to ensure their success they will have to face a number of challenges at home and abroad. Some former allies of these trade leagues remain de jure parts of the Federation, but have since fallen to foreign powers - §YCorfu§! is one particular source of contention, an island which may one day pit the Grand Adirim against the mighty §YMacedonia§!.\n\nIn the center of Italia, the lines between Romana and Punic twist and blur, and the myriad of minor states that occupy territories there are just as transient. From the powerful Christian minorities of §YAncona§!, to the aspiring alchemists of §YEtruscia§!, there are many ambitious players at work within this region. Above all the politics of the Federation, the men of the shadows lie in wait, using their base in §YSaluzzo§! to carry out all sorts of nefarious deeds.\n\nThe future of the Federation seems uncertain, and it is clear the alliance will need a steady hand to guide it through the coming years of tribulation. Chaos and religious war loom over the horizon, but behind these stormy clouds the promise of a better life still beckons every Romqart soul." #hiw
string_start_scandinavia_generic: "The Norsemen have been divided for centuries, fighting petty feuds with one another while the rest of the world moves on without them. In the last few generations however, a remarkable shift has taken place, and what was once a region of a thousand independent cheifdoms have consolidated down into just a handfull of Jarldoms. Unity was brought by figures like §YUlrik the Great§!, King of Norway, who defeated the Swedes and at last secured the borders of the Norwegian people. The breakaway state of §YNorrland§! still evades Swedish dominion for now, but it is only a matter of time before §YSweden§! is strong enough to be a contender for the hegemony over Scandinavia.\n\n§YDanmark§! is a kingdom in decline, for while it was the first of the Scandinavians to unify, it was also the first to fracture. Now split into the '§YThree Danmarks§!', the prolific raiders of the isles seek to unify §YJutland§! and §YSkaneland§! and once again proclaim Danish glory.\n\nRecent years have also seen the rise of adventurism, with figures like §YKnut Stormbringer§!, son of Ulrik, and §YEirik Havendalsson§!, have founded new kingdoms in §YCeltica§! and §YFrisia§! respectively. Norsemen are traveling further afield in search of loot and captives, and despite the gradual centralization of power in their homelands, are finding it easier than ever to make a living through uncontrolled malicious means.\n\nIn §YIceland§!, the Althingi still governs as a collective will of the people, and continues to prosper from the valuable fish and whale trade. Rumors still circle of a land further beyond, beyond even the frontier colonies on §YGreenland§!, that was once known to the Norse but is now long lost.

For centuries, peace reigned in the wake of these conquerors, and all Britons lived in harmony with one another.\n\nEverything changed when the rising nation of §YCeltica§! unified and began a campaign of conquest and intimidation across the Isles, subduing countless smaller tribes and extracting continuous tribute from the largest powers in the west. The only Britons left free of the so-called '§YCeltic Tyranny§!' are those of the §YBrittonic Confederation§!, currently dominated by the §YTrinovantes§!. Celtica stands on the precipice of total dominion, but the fate of the Britons still very much hangs in the balance.\n\nA new threat entered the stage even more recently, heralded by the sound of war horns and the sight of those terrible ships drawing closer to the shore. §YKnut Stormbringer§! and his Viking army invaded Pictland and rapidly carved out a kingdom for himself, destroying all those who stood in his way. He even defeated Celtica, but many Britons view him not as a liberator, but a vile raider like his kin.\n\nEvery faction in this mighty struggle has ambitions of unity - it is only a question of who will at last muster the force to bring about this dream. But will that dream be of §YBrennonia§!, of §YSkaldasker§!, or perhaps of §YAlbion§!? You must take the reins and guide [Root.GetName] to victory, and make your mark on Celtic history!"

Meanwhile, across the diverse landscape, a myriad of breakaway states have emerged, each with its distinct identity and aspirations. These nascent nations, born from the ashes of Carthaginian hegemony, now navigate a complex tapestry of alliances and enmities, seeking to assert their sovereignty in an era marked by uncertainty and opportunity.\n\nAs they stride into this new epoch, these Iberian states are united by a shared legacy of resistance against external domination. The region, a crucible of varied peoples and traditions, thrives on its rich cultural heritage and strategic significance. Here, the echoes of ancient wars mingle with the whispers of diplomatic intrigue and the clamor of burgeoning trade.\n\nThe future of Iberia is unwritten, with each nation poised to etch its mark on the annals of history.

This empire, renowned for its formidable navy and lucrative trade routes, reigned supreme in the Mediterranean, carving an epoch of prosperity and dominance. The fall of Rome signaled Carthage's unrivaled ascendancy, a testament to its strategic prowess and commercial acumen. However, the very elements that spurred its rise - §Yambition and expansion§! - gradually seeded its decline.\n\nOverextension, coupled with internal political strife, eroded its might. Economic downturns, exacerbated by the complex management of its vast territories, marked the beginning of its fall.\n\nIn the contemporary, Carthage, once the beacon of the ancient world, faces a future shrouded in uncertainty. Political turmoil gnaws at its foundations, while new emerging powers threaten its borders. The empire, now a shadow of its former glory, stands at a pivotal crossroads. Will it reclaim its historic supremacy, or will it succumb to the relentless march of time, becoming a poignant symbol of the transient nature of power? As the world watches, Carthage's fate remains an enigma, a captivating chapter in this richly woven alternate history."

Central to their faith is the §YIrmansul§!, a sacred pillar symbolizing the world's axis, linking the heavens and earth in divine harmony. These tribes, often labeled as barbarians by their southern and western neighbors, are united by this shared spiritual heritage, yet constantly vigilant against external threats.\n\nThe Gallic tribes to the west and the enigmatic northmen from the frozen lands pose significant dangers. Despite these looming threats, the Germanic people maintain their unique identity, fiercely resisting cultural and religious encroachment. Their perception as barbarians belies a complex society deeply connected to nature and their deities, with Irmansul epitomizing their spiritual resilience.\n\nIn this volatile environment, the Germanic tribes navigate a delicate balance between preserving their ancient ways and confronting the ever-present menace of neighboring cultures. Their story is one of enduring spirit, cultural pride, and an unyielding struggle to protect their ancestral legacy."

string_start_slav_generic: "In the diverse and tumultuous landscape of Slavia, stretching between Germania, the Baltic, Carpathia, and the steppes, the Slavic pagans hold sway. These peoples, deeply rooted in their religious fundamentals, fervently worship the pantheon of Slavic gods. Their spiritual practices and beliefs are ingrained in every aspect of their society, forming the backbone of their cultural identity.\n\nKashubia, the dominant force in Severoslavia, stands at the forefront of this Slavic world. This powerful entity not only contests the Saxons to the west but also aspires to establish itself as the preeminent power among the Slavic nations. The Kashubians, with their robust military and strong cultural identity, are pivotal in the ongoing struggle to define the future of Slavia.\n\nIn this region marked by religious zeal and cultural pride, the Slavic pagans represent a bastion of ancient traditions amidst the shifting sands of power dynamics. Kashubia's ambitions and conflicts with neighboring powers underscore the broader narrative of a region striving to carve out its destiny in a world of empires and changing allegiances."

string_start_hellenic_generic: "In the Hellenic world, remnants of Alexander's empire endure, influencing the cultural and political landscape. The Diadochi nations, successors of Alexander's fragmented empire, persist in various forms. Seleucia, once a vast empire, now exists as a diminished rump state, precariously positioned on the border of the formidable, and particularly zealous Persian theocratic empire, which casts a long and threatening shadow over the Hellenic remnants, including the beleaguered Seleucia. The landscape is marked by these enduring Hellenistic states, each grappling with their own challenges.\n\nThe Hellenic pantheon, traditionally central to societal norms and governance, now faces an unprecedented challenge. A burgeoning movement, rooted in the diverse regions of the Hellenic sphere, resists the centralization of the pantheon around the Archon, the spiritual head of the Hellenic pantheon, based in Athens. Advocates of this movement seek to return to older, more localized forms of worship, emphasizing regional deities and customs over the established pantheon. This shift threatens the established religious and political order, potentially fracturing the delicate unity of the Hellenic world. As this movement gains momentum, it raises profound questions about identity, tradition, and the future of Hellenic society in a world where old certainties are increasingly questioned."

string_start_persia_generic: "In the lands of Persia, a united Theocratic Empire stands as a formidable power, with its influence extending across diverse lands. Governed through a network of efficient satrapies, the empire maintains a delicate balance of control and autonomy. These satrapies, ranging from the regions of Pontus to Gujarat, are crucial in administering the vast empire, yet they demand significant concessions from the Dastur, the empire's spiritual and political leader.\n\nCentral to Persian policy is the ambitious Satrapy Expansion Plan, a strategic initiative mandating the conquest of specific territories. This plan, endorsed by the satraps, imposes a heavy burden on the Dastur, compelling him to extend Persian dominion over promised lands. This expansionist agenda not only serves to appease the satraps' ambitions but also aims to solidify the empire's hegemony in the region.\n\nAs the empire embarks on this grand plan, it navigates a complex web of political, religious, and military challenges. The Satrapy Expansion Plan represents a critical juncture in Persian history, potentially reshaping the regional power dynamics and further cementing the empire's legacy for centuries to come."

string_start_evangelos_generic: "In 1444, the §YEvangelos§! Christians, exiled from Hellenic realms, such as the ancient Aegyptos, have established themselves in the arid expanse of northern Arabia. They share this harsh land with the polytheistic §YArabic§! natives and §YJewish§! exiles, forming a unique tapestry of faiths. At the heart of the Evangelos world is §YHeliopolis§!, the §YSacred Kingdom§!, which leads the §YSacred Empire of Christ§! and the §YSacred Orders§!.\n\nRecently, there has been a powerful resurgence in the §YEvangelos§! faith. Persecution and hardship have fueled a deep-seated zeal among its followers, driving a collective yearning for a return to their ancestral lands and the restoration of their glory. The devout see their struggles as a divine trial, fostering an intense spiritual fervor that has permeated all levels of society. This fervor is approaching a tipping point, as charismatic leaders rally the faithful, invoking visions of a holy reconquest and the establishment of a new era under Christian dominion.\n\nAs the §YEvangelos§! Christians consolidate their strength, their unyielding faith and burgeoning unity pose a significant challenge to neighboring regions. The zealotry is not only a spiritual awakening but a call to arms, setting the stage for a potential holy war that could reshape the power dynamics of the Middle East. The §YSacred Kingdom§! of §YHeliopolis§! stands ready to lead its people through this pivotal moment, aiming to reclaim their heritage and spread their faith across the Arabian deserts and beyond."

string_start_hordes_generic: "Centuries ago, the §YMongol§! hordes, a force of unparalleled might and mobility, surged across Eurasia. Their conquests, reaching as far as the Baltic Sea, reshaped the world.\nWhen the legendary Khan, Timujin, or better known to history as Ghengis, passing, his eldest sun, Jochi, inherited his vast empire. Jochi maintained the pace of conquest, sparing the §YPersians§! (due to their rich offers of tribute to the Khan), and laying waste to the lands of the Rus and the Finnic peoples of what is now known as the §YBaruun§!. This era of Mongol dominance is etched into history as a time of extraordinary military feats and rapid expansion. However, the once-cohesive Mongol Empire has since fragmented into various successor states. Upon the death of Jochi Khan in 1291, at the ripe old age of 91, his eldest sons of §YOrda§! and §YBatu§! were given the westernmost portions of the empire. These states, sprawling across vast territories within the §YBaruun§!, the §YRusbulak§!,the §YPontiin Tal§!, and spanning the vast §YUral§! mountains, drifted away from their older Mongol roots, embracing a nomadic identity of their own, that of the §YNorrkhan§! and the §YSurnkhan§!.\nIn the 2 centuries following the death of Jochi Khan, the western hordes have drifted very far from their once-great status, with the §YAshig Khanate§!, the primary inheritors of Orda Khan, maintaining the position of the §YIlk Khan§!, the Great Khan of the West. Not all that shines is golden, however, as the Ashigi tribe is in shambles following a disasterous raid into the Finnic lands of Karelia, resulting in the aptly named §YKarelian Wars§!, in which a coalition of Finnic nations banded together and soundly defeated a large host of Ashigi warriors in the northern forests. Meanwhile, to the east of Ashig, §YVakkas Khan§!, the Khan of §YBarut§!, the primary inheritance of Batu Khan, eagerly awaits his opportunity to wrest the title of the Ilk Khan from the weak and damaged §YBaki Ashig§!. Overall, the western hordes remain deeply decentralized, plagued by internal strife and incessant conflicts amongst themselves.\nThe legacy of the Mongol conquests lingers, but their unity and formidable power have given way to a landscape of divided realms, each vying for dominance in the shadow of their former glory."

string_start_deccan_generic: "The lands of the §YDeccan§! in the south of India has entered a period of turmoil following invasion by the §YNadea Empire§!, which led to the collapse of ancient powers and the rise of new ones.\n\nAlong the southern coast, a number of enterprising Islamic merchants have established practically independent states for themselves, and now dominate the trades of the Coromandel, much to the ire of the local trade guilds. The remnant kingdom of §YNuwara§! clings on to dreams of Lankan unity in the face of this Islamic incursion, while the princes of §YMalabar§! suffer under religious fragmentation and instability which invariably threatens the security of their spices exports.\n\nIn the core of the region, the rajas of §YMaisuru§! have established a lasting dominance, holding many of the smaller states around it as tributary states and having the largest army of any of the princes. Shadows of former glory still remain on the periphery as well - the once mighty Chola dynasty rule the small fort of §YNijachola§! in the Tamil foothills, and §YPandya§! have consolidated a small realm around Madurai, and the §YHoysala§! cling to life in the Carnatic uplands. Amidst these dynastic titans, the trading nations of the Tamil coastline seek to make greater fortunes than their larger neighbor. The guilds of §YTanjore§! may threaten the independence of the nation's trade, but the profits from the lucrative pearl trade is likely to sustain the city for years to come.\n\nThe north has become a violent and uncertain place after the Nadean armies ravaged it fifty years ago. The §YSangama§! dynasty has risen from the ashes and now dreams of dominance over all of the Deccan and Coromandel, but will have to content with the recently defeated Mysoreans first. §YJain§! states hug the western shores, having been mostly spared from the devastation, and continue on their everlasting quest for enlightenment. The threat of the §YMaratha Confederation§! looms heavily over all these states, an empire which has had a series of ambitious campaigns that crippled the rajas of §YGolconda§! and §YBijapur§!. One fort eludes the Marathas however - that of §YSimylla§!, the last remnant of the ancient Indo-Greeks in the Deccan.\n\nTime will tell what will become of India, but in the middle of the 15th century, uncertainty is rampant. With so many powers, new and old, competing for dominance, it is truly anyone's game."

desc_feudalism:0 "Over time, most societies develop a need for a common structure with stronger and more permanent institutions of government. Since the time of the Carthaginian Empire this need came to be filled by a number of institutions and customs that taken together are often considered to be part of the North African, and southern European Feudal system. For similar reasons, permanent government and societal systems have formed all over the world, some of which have roots that go far further back than Feudalism itself.\nUnlike the other Institutions, 'Feudalism' covers a wide range of different systems and exists from the start in all parts of the world where a strong tradition of Urbanizm, Institutionalized Government and Social Stratification has reached a critical point. The institution can spread from contact with any of these cultures, or in some cases begin to grow on its own in a society that fulfills certain criteria."
 desc_renaissance:0 "Since the 14th century, the wealthy and powerful in the coastal Mediterranean states have been patronizing artists and scholars willing to explore the old Punic, Latin and Greek societies of their forefathers. As a cultural movement, the Renaissance already encompasses most of the region and has had a profound impact on literature, art, philosophy and music. Humanist scholars are also analyzing the society in which they live, comparing it to the ideals of the classical philosophers. At the turn of $YEAR$ Renaissance humanism has grown into a more mature movement, ready to permeate all aspects of society. A new ideal for rulers as well as those who are ruled is spreading as quickly as the early printers can distribute copies of these new ideas. A true Renaissance humanist is an expert on everything from politics and philosophy to art, textual analysis, music and architecture. The Renaissance is now ready to reshape the world to better fit the classical ideals."
 desc_printing_press:1 "The ability to mass-produce the written word would revolutionize the spread of information, and in many ways early modern society as a whole. Pioneered by many Renaissance men, the new art helped fuel the Renaissance by making the translated classics more widely available. Later the Reformation benefitted greatly from the ability to spread critical publications and translations of the Archonic diktats.\n\nNow that Printing has matured as a technique and spread throughout the Greek world, hundreds of thousands of copies of everything from religious and political pamphlets to scientific treatises and instructions on how to behave are circulating the continent. With print shops growing evermore commonplace, rulers have found it hard to contain the new technique, as the comparatively easy means of production makes it easy for censorship to be sidestepped by moving business across a border or even just changing the name on a title page."
 desc_global_trade:0 "Goods have been moved across continents since antiquity. But where this was previously limited to a set number of routes and goods such as the manufactured goods of India and China finding their way across the Indian Ocean and along the Silk Road, all trade is now increasingly becoming part of a greater world network. With the discovery of the Americas, sea routes around Africa and the crossing of the Pacific Ocean, local trade networks are being connected into one world-spanning interconnected web.\n\nSilver mined in the Andes is now being boxed and taken via Europe all the way to China and India. Iron mined and wrought in Scandinavia is being sold in West Africa by Celtic merchants, and others are making a fortune just distributing cloth and spices within the South East Asian trade sphere. Local Indian merchants are investing in future European trade ventures. It may still be early to speak of a truly Global Economy but surely the first seeds have been sown."
 desc_manufactories:0 "While a number of technical innovations during the course of the 16th and 17th centuries have increased the output of production for some products such as iron or cloth to an extent, the biggest improvement in the field of production has come in the form of new forms of organization. By creating manufactories, often outside the city limits, merchant capitalists can both bypass the ancient guild laws that inhibit mass production as well as pioneer ways to increase production through the organization and specialization of labor in one place. The forerunners of the later Industrialization are able to increase output by facilitating access to raw materials and mass organization of labor rather than by expensive new machinery. This is in itself a huge change over the often heavily regulated methods of old, however, and together with later technical advances this new mode of production will come to revolutionize society."
 desc_enlightenment:0 "The last century has seen Rationalism and Empiricism gaining an ever-increasing popularity among the great minds of the age. In letters, publications and coffee houses, kings, scientists, philosophers and littérateurs are discussing the merits of tolerance, the scientific method and the spreading of the ideals of the Enlightenment to all of humanity. From universities or courts of enlightened monarchs, expeditions are being sent to measure, catalogue, weigh and map the world so that we can better understand the laws that govern the things around us. Others discuss the laws that govern society and try to reach an understanding of the Rights of Man.\n\nGreat projects such as the colossal undertaking of creating a complete encyclopedia of all knowledge or a complete index of all plants, animals and fungi in the world are being pursued for the greater good of humanity. The Light of Reason has been lit and many will not rest until it has been brought to all corners of the earth."
