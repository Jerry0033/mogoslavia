 #Mogoslavia
 ms_mogoslav_kingdom: "Mogoslav Matriarchy"
 ms_mogoslav_kingdom_desc: "The Mogoslav Matriarchy, a beacon on the brink of the Western Eurasian steppe, defied tradition. Here, the crown rested not solely on the brow of a male heir, but upon the most capable descendant, be they son or daughter.  Mogoslav princesses were raised alongside princes, honed in the arts of war, diplomacy, and navigating the intricate web of Mongol politics. Whispers of legendary Khagan queens echoed through the ages - rulers who led victorious campaigns and forged alliances that spanned from the Caspian Sea to the Pacific. In the Mogoslav kingdom, it was strength, not gender, that determined who wore the magnificent moonstone crown."

 #Tatars
 ms_semi_nomadic_tribe: "Semi-Nomadic Tribe"
 ms_semi_nomadic_tribe_desc: "Once masters of the windswept plains, the Tatars of the Pontic Steppe were lured to a new way of life. Drawn by the wealth and security of nearby cities, they began to settle along the fringes of these urban centers.  This proximity bred a fascinating transformation. The once nomadic herders adopted aspects of city life, building permanent dwellings and engaging in trade.  Their social structure mirrored this shift. A warrior elite emerged, offering protection to the city-dwellers in exchange for tribute and land. This feudal system, though a stark contrast to their nomadic past, proved successful, allowing the Tatars to retain their martial prowess while flourishing in the new urban world."

 #Holmgardr
 ms_multicultural_court_tribal_reform: "Multicultural Court"
 ms_multicultural_court_tribal_reform_desc: "The court is a fusion of Norse and Slavic law, a complex interplay of ancient customs and pragmatic rulings. A jarl and a knyaz, symbols of their respective cultures, preside jointly, their decisions often reached through a blend of consensus and authority. Norse legal concepts of wergild and the Thing coexist with Slavic traditions of communal justice and the role of wise elders. The court's proceedings are a dynamic dialogue, blending oral law with written records, where both Norse and Slavic legal traditions are honored and adapted to the unique challenges of this multicultural society."
 ms_ruslander_jarldom: "Ruslander Jarldom"
 ms_ruslander_jarldom_desc: "The Ruslander realm is a dominion of iron, ruled by a lord of unyielding will. His grasp extends over all, from the loftiest spire to the humblest hut. Fear is the coin of the realm, and obedience its tribute. No whisper dares rise against the sovereign’s decree, for the watcher’s eye is ever present. The people are but tilled fields, their lives ordered and sown by a master’s hand. In this kingdom of shadows, hope withers, and the spirit is crushed beneath the weight of absolute power."

 ms_ruslander_huskarl_recruitment_reform: "Huskarl Recruitment"
 ms_ruslander_huskarl_recruitment_reform_desc: "Our Varangian roots can't be forgotten, once we were fierce vikings, the best foot troops known. We need to rekindle the love for infantry specialisation. By recruiting the best fighters from all over our nation, we can train Huskarl regiments. These men will form an elite part of our Land forces."
 ms_rsh_hestridandi: "Hestridandi"
 ms_rsh_hestridandi_desc: "The Hestridandi is composed of fortified Ruslander settlements on the borderlands of it's territory. These settlements are primarily inhabited by Hestridandi Horsemen.

 rsh_ruslander_sjalfbyrgi_desc: "The Sjalfbyrgi is a regionwide assembly of rich Borgarmenn. They showcase their investments, and give the possibility for other Borgarmenn to invest into their assets. Even though they don't contribute to the state, it does improve infrastructure for the state to use when investing themselves."

 rsh_westernized_administration_reform_desc: "By replacing our old deprectad administrators with bright ambitious minds from all over Europe we will diversify our court, allowing us to be more competitive with our neighbours in the domain of technologic advances."
